# lambdanative-macros
Some extra macros for lambdanative that make me feel more comfortable.
Just place global-macros.scm in your app's folder.


These are old and probably not the best, but I imagine they mostly work if I put them up. 
(I am no longer working with LambdaNative/Android at the moment so I can't test them)
